**Problem Statement**: Identify countries with the lowest fertility rates and discuss the potential long-term socio-economic challenges they may face, such as workforce shortages and aging populations.
```sql
SELECT country, fertility_rate
FROM world_population
ORDER BY fertility_rate ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 12. Assessment of Positive Population Growth
**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the total population increase in countries with positive growth rates, focusing on economic opportunities, challenges in resource allocation, and environmental sustainability.
```sql
SELECT SUM(net_change) AS total_positive_growth
FROM world_population

```sql
SELECT country, yearly_change
FROM world_population
ORDER BY yearly_change DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 15. Demographic Structure and Population Distribution
**Problem Statement**: Group countries by median age and analyze the population distribution within these age categories to understand demographic structures, potential future workforce composition, and healthcare needs.
```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN median_age < 20 THEN 'Below 20'
    WHEN median_age BETWEEN 20 AND 39 THEN '20-39'
    WHEN median_age BETWEEN 40 AND 59 THEN '40-59'
    ELSE '60 and above'
  END AS age_group,
  SUM(population) AS total_population
FROM world_population
GROUP BY age_group;
```

### 16. Evaluation of Aging Populations
**Problem Statement**: Identify countries with a median age above a certain threshold and discuss the challenges associated with aging populations, including healthcare demands, pension system sustainability, and potential impacts on economic productivity.
```sql
SELECT country, median_age
FROM world_population
WHERE median_age > 40
ORDER BY median_age DESC;
```

### 17. Socioeconomic Impacts of High Urbanization Rates
